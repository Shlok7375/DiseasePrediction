# ü©∫ Disease Prediction System (Naive Bayes + Keras Neural Network)

This project implements a hybrid disease prediction system that combines a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier and a Keras-based feedforward neural network to identify the top 3 most probable diseases based on user-supplied symptoms. The system handles free-text input with potential typographical errors and synonyms, and returns ranked predictions from both models with confidence scores.

- Binary symptom vectorization (645 features)
- Dual-model prediction (Naive Bayes + Neural Network)
- Top-3 ranked predictions with class probabilities
- Robust preprocessing and vector generation
- Clean CLI-based interaction via `main.py`
